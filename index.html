      <h2> <u>About Service</u></h2><br>
    </center>
    <p class="about"> The Fruit Service was founded in <b> Hajipur, Bihar</b>, which is famous for<i> Mango, Banana and Lichi</i>. One of the most significant selling points for fresh fruits and vegetables is that these foodstuffs are considered by dietitians, physicians and consumers themselves to be "healthy." This is because fruits and vegetables are often high in fiber, low in calories, often contain essential nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium and folic acid, and they may be high in compounds that offer significant health benefits. However, the public may not be aware of the nutritional profile of a specific fruit or vegetable. Labels for prepackaged fresh produce can contain information that is valuable to consumers who are concerned about what it is they are reading.</p>
